## Features and Functionalities

- **User Registration and Login**: Users can register with their details and log in to the system.
- **Dashboard**: After logging in, users can access their dashboard to view available candidates.
- **Candidate Details**: Users can view detailed information about each candidate, including their promises, assets, liabilities, background, political views, and regional views.
- **Voting**: Users can cast their vote for a candidate. Once a vote is cast, it is recorded in the database, and the user cannot vote again.
- **Vote Confirmation**: After voting, users receive a confirmation with a reference number for their vote.
- **Logout**: Users can log out of the system securely.

We hope this project serves as a useful tool for conducting online elections and provides a good learning experience for those interested in web development and database management.
